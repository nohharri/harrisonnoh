	In the winter of 2016, I had the pleasure of taking Game Development (EECS 494) with <span class='link'><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyrgibson' target='blank'>Professor Jeremy Gibson Bond.</a></span> He was certainly one of the best teachers I had at Michigan, taking great interest in his craft and expecting the best out of his students. Through his class, I gained a better understanding of object-oriented programming through the scope of C# and Unity. I could relate to the video game world the most during my student career at the University of Michigan, as my strong belief in user experiences translated well with the immersive interaction people have when playing video games. There are a lot of parallels between user experience design and video game design. They both strive to make an engaging and unique experience to the specific user. I wanted to showcase some of the exciting projects I had the opportunity to make with some great classmates.

	<h2>Legend of Zelda - Classic Game Remake</h2>
	As an intro to Unity, we were tasked with recreating a classic video game. As one of the options, my partner and I decided to tackle <span class='link'><a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda'>Legend of Zelda NES.</a></span>

	As it was our first full-fledged game in Unity, we took a lot of time to develop something that seemed initially like a simple game. As a team, there were some creative differences within the group. Meeting up proved to be very difficult, as schedules never lined up and we faced a myriad of merge conflicts. A lot of these debugging errors stemmed from working on the same scene in Unity.
<br><br>
	Throughout the project, I was in charge of the movement code and implementing most of the enemies. How we decided to implement the enemies was one of the more difficult part of the project. While inheritence seemed to be a good idea, none of the enemy movements were similar. Some enemies were bound to the grid, while others could move freely. Most of the enemies ended up requiring their own unique code.
	<br><br>
	We managed to work through our differences by understanding our common goals. Even though our schedules conflicted and wanted to implement our code differently, we both really pushed to finish the game. You can check out the final product below (works only in Firefox, Safari).

	<h2>Commuter North</h2>
	Our second project was to rapidly prototype a video game within two weeks. The goal was to implement an original concept while showcasing the bare mechanics and core functionalities of the game without going too much into unnecessary features. 

	<br><br>
	Our hero moves through an empty abyss filled with snow and darkness.The last bus has departed and our hero is stuck on North Campus. Manuever from bus stop to bus stop before you are confronted by winter's deadly touch!
	<br><br>
	From idea conception to implementation, our group of four was able to complete a fun horror game with the playful twist of the environment relating to Michigan. The most important mechanics were disorienting the player through random shifts in the character's position and limiting the user's sight through fog and snow. What I worked on were the text engine and footprints. The footprints were used to lay out a path for the player so the disorientation did not get too heavy. The player can then detect their own footsteps in the snow so they were not to continuously travel an incorrect path. Developing the game was definitely a lot of fun.

	<h2>Puffer</h2>
	I really fell in love with this project. Our third project was to create another rapid prototype with three new partners. Puffer is a game based on a little puffer fish that swells up and sucks up fish to gain their effect, navigating through little puzzles throughout the 2d sidescroller.

	I wore many hats, thinking of the core mechanics, programming, and designing all the sprites. Even though it wasn't emphasized, I really wanted to develop a colorful world for the game. The core experience could only be captured through the depiction of bright and unique characters, while trying to convey the abilities of each creature. For example, the electric eel is used to depict something that can't be touched, while the turtle's large and sturdy body conveys its unbreakable shell. The goldfish is smaller than the puffer fish, depicting that the fish can be eaten. An important part of game design is conveying ideas without explicitly saying them and that was the main idea with my sprites. The game is still in development.
