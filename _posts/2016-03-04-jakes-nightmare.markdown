short_description: My friend <span class='link'><a href="http://jkotzian.com" target='_blank'>James Kotzian</a></span> and I decided to enter a 48-hour game development competition at the University of Michigan - the Turkey Game Jam where 12 teams entered. Some teams had already developed their ideas in-depth while we came in with nothing.

My friend <span class='link'><a href="http://jkotzian.com" target='_blank'>James Kotzian</a></span> and I decided to enter a 48-hour game development competition at the University of Michigan: the Turkey Game Jam where 12 teams entered. Some teams had already developed their ideas in-depth while we came in with nothing.

<div class='paragraph'>We conceptually had no idea what we wanted to do or what language we were even going to use. But we had three capable programmers in me, James, and Patrick Shin, a person who joined our team last minute. We began with whiteboarding our idea. James began with a very simple and somewhat random thought.
<br><br>
"Guys. What if we have a chair? And like the chair is magic." 
<br>
James said.
<br><br>
Don't worry. He's smart. He got an offer from Apple. But he also didn't know who Tim Cook was so I don't know what to make of that.
<br><br>
We slowly hashed our idea and that resulted in a 2d sidescrolling platformer. The theme of the game jam was multiplayer. I was surprised to know that we were the only team to do a cooperative game rather than PvP. The basis of the idea was a transport mission where your character is the door of a sleepwalking boy named Jake. As two doors, you and another player must nagivate through the dangers of the night and transport Jake back to safety. The interesting part of the game is that the doors act as portals. By pressing down (A key or down key), players are able to open their doors, acting as portals from one player to the next, allowing Jake to travel through these portals and back to safety.

<br><br>
Instead of using a popular game engine like Unity, we used Crafty.js, a very poorly designed game engine. We really wanted to test out game development in Javascript and after a short period of research, we concluded on using Crafty.

Everyone did a portion of the programming, while James did a lot of hacky things to make Crafty more accomodating to what we wanted to do. I was in charge with the animation engine and for all of the sprites and design. You can check out the art at Behance down below.

	Crazy enough, we ended up winning second place! It was definitely one of the most fun things I've done and made me consider a career in game programming. You can check out the full game below:
