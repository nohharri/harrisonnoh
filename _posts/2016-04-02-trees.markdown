<div class="paragraph">

	<h2>Basic Terminology</h2>
	<strong>Depth:</strong> number of edges from the node to the tree's root node where the root's depth is always 0.
	<br>
	<strong>Height:</strong> number of edges from the node to the its lowest leaf where all leaves will have a height of 0.

	<h2>Breadth-First Traversal</h2>
	A breadth first traversal indicates visiting it from the breadth of the tree.
	<h3>Level-Order</h3>
	<h2>Depth-First Traversal</h2>
	Depth first traversal indicates using depth instead of each level.
	<h3>Preorder</h3>
	<h3>Inorder</h3>
	<h3>Postorder</h3>

	<h2>Calculate the height of a node.</h2>
