	<h2>Difference between C++/C and Java/C#</h2>
	The big difference between these languages is garbage collection. When allocating memory in C++ or C using the new/malloc operators, they must be deleted as memory is not deleted by itself. This is where garbage collection comes along. Java and Csharp will free up the memory while C++ everything must be deleted itself that was created on the heap.
