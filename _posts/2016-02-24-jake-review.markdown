		Picking a roommate can be a <b>BIG</b> decision and this year I had the pleasure of rooming with Jake Marples. Sometimes he can be kind of annoying, but honestly he was one of the best roommates I've had in my life. If you're considering rooming with Jake, check out my review.

	<h2>Build</h2>
	Definitely one of Jake's best attributes has to be his height. Coming in at 6' 3", Jake's height really contributes to his sexual prowess. It definitely comes in handy when you're a shorter guy. As long as he doesn't talk, his presence in a group really strengthens its credibility when you have him present. Jake's large butt can sometimes be a problem.
	Countless chips and xboxes have been destroyed by the large derriere.

	<br><br>
	<h2>Personality</h2>
	Jake has a lot of good banter, but sometimes it can get excessive. His humour is geared more towards the dad side, but somehow makes it work with his dorky personality. His biggest flaw has to be his hypocrisy. When Jake was recruiting for jobs, he lacked on dishes and regular house chores, but after having a job and no school, Jake has become a tyrant, constantly barrading the group chat with requests to clean the house and pay rent.

	<br><br>
	<h2>Conflict Resolution</h2> 
	One of Jake's best qualities you can exploit is his need to be accepted. Therefore, not a lot of conflicts stem from Jake. When they do, Jake always laughs it off, as he fears confrontation.

	<br><br>
	<h2>Girlfriend</h2>

	You can't talk about a dude without talking about the Misses. Jake's girlfriend is certainly not a problem around the house. Her visits are scarce and she does the dishes sometimes. She wille take your food if it is in view, though. Other than that, she usually stays in Jake's room so she is usually not seen or heard. Also not saying that's a bad thing. Jake's girlfriend is easily one of the top 5 funniest girls I know. Jake's really not funny compared to her.

	Jake's taste in clothing leaves something to be desired. He really likes button downs and khakis alongside dark grey vans. As a sneaker enthusiast, Jake is probably the most basic white guy you'll ever meet. He has three shoes: one for business, one for running, and one for everything else. Ugh. Shoot me now.

	Jake is easily one of the best guys I know. It would be an honor to room with him again. He is funny, loyal, and caring. That's why I have to give him a Jake out of 10.
